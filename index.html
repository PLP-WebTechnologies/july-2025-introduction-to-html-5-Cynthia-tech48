      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Software development is the process of designing, coding, testing, and maintaining applications and systems to meet user needs. It involves translating user requirements into functional programs through a structured and collaborative workflow. Developers work with various programming languages, tools, and frameworks to create software that solves real-world problems or enhances business efficiency. The development cycle often includes planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and ongoing maintenance.</p>

    <section id="methodologies">
      <h2>Methodologies</h2>
      <p>Common software development methodologies include Agile, Waterfall, and DevOps, each offering different approaches to project management and delivery. Agile emphasizes iterative development, continuous feedback, and adaptability to change. Waterfall is a more linear and sequential model, suitable for projects with clearly defined requirements. DevOps focuses on integrating development and operations teams to enable faster, more reliable releases through automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery pipelines. Choosing the right methodology depends on project scope, team dynamics, and stakeholder expectations.</p>

    <section id="best-practices">
      <h2>Best Practices</h2>
      <p>Effective software development relies on best practices such as code reviews, version control, continuous integration, and writing clean, maintainable code. Code reviews help maintain quality and reduce bugs by allowing team members to collaboratively improve code before it's merged. Version control systems like Git ensure collaboration and track changes across the development lifecycle. Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) automate testing and deployment, reducing manual errors. Writing modular, well-documented code enhances readability, facilitates onboarding, and supports long-term scalability.</p>
